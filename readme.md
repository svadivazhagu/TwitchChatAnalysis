# twitch-chat-analysis

hypothesis:
if a a chat has a high similarity in Emotes and is experiencing higher frequency of messages at a given timestamp,
there is something 'exciting' happening on stream.

potential:

if we can determine 'exciting' moments on stream (positive or negative), can calculate times with which to generate clips from - automatic clip generator?
